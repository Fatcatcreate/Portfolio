### Insight
1. All models are simplifications, 'All models are wrong but some aree useful'
2. Model is useful but can be judged by data, but depends on whether the past is a good measure of the future
3. Assumption driven vs data driven regime.
4. What have we excluded from the models
5. Compare models that all model similar things to try to determine things about reality, cat metaphor
6. Useful even if wrong
7. Models dependent on value judgements for our models and what WE value in terms of society
8. Error term is a function of those making it
9. Model can work very well in interpolation space but vary drastically in extrapolation space
